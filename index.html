    <li>You could live longer.
        <p>Recent studies found that coffee drinkers are less likely to die from some of the leading causes of death in women: 
            coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease.</p>
    </li>
    <li>You're less likely to develop heart failure.
        <p>Drinking one to two cups of coffee a day may help ward off heart 
            failure, when a weakened heart has difficulty pumping enough blood to the body.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Your liver will thank you.
        <p> Both regular and decaf coffee seem to have a protective effect on your liver.</p>
