<h1> History of coffee</h1>
<p>Wild coffee plants, probably from Kefa (Kaffa), Ethiopia, were taken to southern Arabia and placed under cultivation
     in the 15th century. One of many legends about the discovery of coffee is that of Kaldi, an Arab goatherd who was
      puzzled by the strange antics of his flock. About 850 CE Kaldi supposedly sampled the berries of the evergreen bush 
      on which the goats were feeding and, on experiencing a sense of exhilaration, proclaimed his discovery to the world.

<p> Coffee was introduced into one European country after another throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. 
    Many accounts are recorded of its prohibition or approval as a religious, political, and medical potion.
     By the end of the 17th century, coffeehouses were flourishing across Britain, the British colonies in America, 
    and continental Europe.</p>
